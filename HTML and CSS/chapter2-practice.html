        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            Molly has been starring out of her window for an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>,
            <i>New Scientist</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of 
            <cite>On The Road</cite>. It has been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls
            the more she feels free
        </p>
        <p>She had spend the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the 
            refugee of people who had no better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the screte
            of the <attr title="Deoxybinuclear acid">DNA</attr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had something
            better to do.
